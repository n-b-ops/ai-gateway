## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-05-14

Maintenance release updating the project baseline from Go 1.24 to Go 1.25. No public API or behaviour changes.

### Changed

- **Go toolchain baseline**: Updated `go.mod` to require Go 1.25.
- **Container builds**: Updated the source-build Docker image from `golang:1.24-alpine` to `golang:1.25-alpine`.
- **CI and releases**: Updated GitHub Actions test, integration, lint, and release jobs to use Go 1.25.x.
- **Lint tooling**: Updated the CI `golangci-lint` version from `v2.1.0` to `v2.4.0` for Go 1.25 support.
- **Documentation**: Updated README badges and contributor/internal docs to advertise Go 1.25+.

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-05-12

Internal quality release completing the integration-test harness. No public API or behaviour changes.

### Added

- **`test/integration/http/`** — HTTP-layer integration tests (build tag: `integration`):
  - `TestChatCompletion_*`: non-streaming and streaming chat completions through the in-process gateway with stub providers.
  - `TestModels_*`: model listing, provider filtering, and empty-registry edge cases.
  - `TestProxy_PassThrough`, `TestProxy_AuthHeadersInjected`, `TestProxy_NoProvider`: pass-through proxy tests against a live `httptest.Server` upstream.
- **`test/integration/plugins/`** — Plugin-chain integration tests (build tag: `integration`):
  - `TestPluginChain_WordFilter_BlockedWord` / `_CleanRequest`: word-filter blocks/passes requests at `before_request`.
  - `TestPluginChain_ResponseCache_Hit`: cache short-circuits the provider on the second identical request (same plugin instance registered at both `before_request` and `after_request`).
  - `TestPluginChain_OnError_Fires`: verifies `on_error` stage fires when the provider returns an error.
- **`test/integration/strategies/`** — Strategy integration tests (build tag: `integration`):
  - `TestStrategy_Fallback_PrimaryFails_SecondarySucceeds`, `_AllFail`: fallback routing behaviour.
  - `TestStrategy_LoadBalance_DistributesRequests`: 40 requests, each provider must receive ≥20%.
  - `TestStrategy_LeastLatency_LocksOntoFastestSeen`: seeds both providers, then asserts the faster one handles ≥80% of post-seed requests.

### Fixed

- **`gateway.go`**: `pctx.Skip = true` set by a `before_request` plugin (e.g. `response-cache`) was silently ignored — the gateway now short-circuits provider dispatch and returns the cached response directly. `after_request` plugins (logging, metrics) still fire.
- **`internal/strategies/leastlatency.go`**: Cold-start bug where the strategy locked onto the first-ever provider and never explored others. Unseen providers are now sampled before falling back to the lowest-p50 selection.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: Integration job now runs `make test-integration` (which includes `-tags=integration`) instead of a bare `go test` that silently skipped all integration tests.

### Changed

- **`AGENTS.md`**: Updated Testing Conventions section to document unit and integration test suites with build tags, Make targets, and Postgres requirements.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Replaced outdated "Integration tests require real provider API keys" section with a step-by-step "How to add an integration test" guide.

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-05-11

Internal architecture release completing the `cmd/ferrogw` refactor. No public API or behaviour changes.

### Changed

- **`cmd/ferrogw` refactor — Phases 2–6**: Moved all remaining business logic out of `cmd/ferrogw/` into dedicated `internal/` packages. `main.go` is now 59 lines of Cobra wiring + plugin imports.
  - `internal/httpserver/` — HTTP server constructor (`server.go`) and Prometheus connection tracker (`conntracker.go`)
  - `internal/proxy/` — Pass-through reverse proxy and model scanner (benchmarks preserved)
  - `internal/handler/` — All `/v1/*` HTTP handlers: chat completions, completions, embeddings, images, models
  - `internal/middleware/` — Rate-limit middleware and proxy-auth middleware (joined existing CORS)
  - `internal/dashboard/` — Template rendering, pprof wiring, and startup logo
  - `internal/httpserver/router.go` — Full Chi router wiring
  - `internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go` — Gateway construction, provider registration, config loading, startup banner, and `Serve()` entry point

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-05-06

Feature release adding official Python and TypeScript SDKs, Helm chart distribution via ArtifactHub, and Replicate streaming support.

### Added

- **Official TypeScript SDK** ([ferro-labs/ferrolabs-typescript-sdk](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrolabs-typescript-sdk)): First-party TypeScript/JavaScript client library for the Ferro Labs AI Gateway — supports chat, streaming, embeddings, and image generation across 30+ providers.
- **Official Python SDK** ([ferro-labs/ferrolabs-python-sdk](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrolabs-python-sdk)): First-party Python client library for the Ferro Labs AI Gateway — works with any LLM or framework.
- **Helm charts on ArtifactHub** ([ferro-labs on ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=ferro-labs)): Ferro Labs Helm charts are now discoverable and installable via ArtifactHub, the standard Kubernetes package registry.
- **Replicate streaming** ([#108](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/pull/108), relates to [#46](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/issues/46)): The Replicate provider now implements `core.StreamProvider`. Streaming requests send `stream: true` to the Replicate prediction API, follow the returned stream URL, and parse Replicate SSE events (`output`, `done`, `error`) into the gateway's normalized `StreamChunk` format. Includes mock SSE test coverage.
- **Postgres integration tests**: 15 integration tests in `test/integration/` using testcontainers-go to spin up a real Postgres 16 container. Covers key store CRUD, config store persistence, request log write/list/paginate/delete, and bootstrap factory functions. Runs in CI after unit tests pass.

### Changed

- **README**: Added SDK links, ArtifactHub badge, and updated provider/SDK documentation for both English and Chinese READMEs.
- **Internal refactor**: Extracted CORS middleware, SSE streaming, error helpers, and store factories from `cmd/ferrogw/` into `internal/middleware`, `internal/sse`, `internal/apierror`, and `internal/bootstrap` with full test coverage — no public API changes.

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-04-28

Feature release adding first-class Ollama Cloud support and broader embedding coverage while keeping the gateway's public API OpenAI-compatible for end users.

### Added

- **Ollama Cloud provider** ([#94](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/issues/94)): Added `ollama-cloud` as a separate provider from local `ollama`, using Ollama Cloud's documented `https://ollama.com/api` endpoints with Bearer token authentication via `OLLAMA_API_KEY`.
- **OpenAI-compatible gateway surface for Ollama Cloud**: Users can call the existing `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with normal OpenAI-style payloads while the provider internally adapts requests to Ollama Cloud's native `/api/chat` API.
- **Streaming and model discovery**: Added native NDJSON streaming support and live model discovery from `/api/tags`, exposed through the gateway's normalized streaming and model-list interfaces.
- **Ollama Cloud model catalog entries**: Added `ollama-cloud/*` catalog entries for initial direct Cloud model IDs, including `gpt-oss:120b`, `gpt-oss:20b`, `qwen3-coder:480b`, and `deepseek-v3.1:671b`, in both the primary and embedded backup catalogs.
- **Expanded embeddings**: Bedrock, Cohere, Databricks, Fireworks, Gemini, Mistral, Novita, Together, and Vertex AI now implement the gateway's `EmbeddingProvider` interface, advertise the `embed` capability, and route `/v1/embeddings` requests through provider-native or OpenAI-compatible embedding APIs with normalized vectors and token-usage responses.
- **Embedding provider tests and registry guardrails**: Added package-local embedding tests for success, invalid input, upstream errors, auth/path mapping, and usage mapping, plus a registry consistency test that keeps `CapabilityEmbed` aligned with actual `EmbeddingProvider` implementations.
- **Implementation plan documentation**: Added `docs/ollama-cloud-implementation-plan.md` documenting provider identity, API mapping, catalog policy, testing scope, and known open questions.

### Changed

- **Provider registry and examples**: Updated provider registration, stability tests, config examples, Docker environment comments, and README provider counts for the new 30th provider.
- **Catalog pricing policy for Ollama Cloud**: Ollama Cloud catalog entries use `null` token pricing because Ollama currently documents plan/GPU-usage-based limits rather than fixed per-token rates.
- **Proxy scope**: Ollama Cloud intentionally does not advertise pass-through proxy support yet because Ollama Cloud's documented direct API is `/api/*`, not `/v1/*`.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-09

Patch release focused on security maintenance, cache correctness, and refreshed project messaging. This release keeps the `v1.0.x` line stable while improving the published release notes for GitHub releases.

### Security

- **Dependabot: AWS SDK EventStream decoder DoS**: Upgraded `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/bedrockruntime` from `v1.50.1` to `v1.50.4` and `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/protocol/eventstream` from `v1.7.6` to `v1.7.8` to address GitHub advisory `GHSA-xmrv-pmrh-hhx2`. The patched versions prevent malformed EventStream frames from triggering a panic in affected AWS SDK decoder paths.

### Fixed

- **Cache eviction at capacity** ([#83](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/pull/83), fixes [#43](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/issues/43)): When the response cache reached `max_entries`, new responses were dropped instead of replacing stale entries, which effectively disabled caching once the store filled up. The cache now evicts the earliest-expiring entry first, stores the incoming response, and includes regression coverage for deterministic eviction order.

### Improved

- **README polish**: Refined the README content and release documentation for the `v1.0.4` maintenance release so the project overview, positioning, and upgrade story are clearer for users landing on the repository or release page.
- **GitHub release notes**: Tag-driven releases now use the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as the source for the GitHub release body, then append a full changelog link at the bottom. This keeps release pages richer, more descriptive, and aligned with the repository changelog.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-01

### Security

- **Dockerfile runs as non-root user**: Added `ferro` user/group in `Dockerfile.release`. Container no longer runs as root.
- **Constant-time auth comparison**: Admin middleware now uses `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` consistently for all key comparisons, preventing timing side-channels.

### Improved

- **Template caching**: Dashboard page templates are parsed once at startup instead of on every request — eliminates per-request `template.ParseFS` overhead.
- **Dashboard redesign**: Improved layout, navigation, and styling across all dashboard pages.
- **CLI polish**: Consistent color helpers, cleaner output formatting, ASCII-safe log messages (replaced unicode dashes/arrows).

### Added

- **`MASTER_KEY` environment variable**: Single credential that authenticates at gateway startup — no stored keys required. Checked first in the auth chain using `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`. Grants full admin scope.
- **`ferrogw init`**: First-run setup command — generates a `fgw_`+32-hex master key with 128-bit entropy, writes a minimal `config.yaml`. Never writes secrets to disk.
- **Dashboard login page** (`/dashboard/login`): Validates key via `/admin/health`, stores in `localStorage`, shows Admin / Read Only badge, and hides write actions for read-only sessions.
- **`/admin/health` returns scopes**: The health endpoint now includes the authenticated key's scopes so clients can determine permission level without a separate request.
- **`.env.example`**: Full reference file documenting `MASTER_KEY`, all 29 provider API keys, storage backends, rate limiting, and CORS origins. Bootstrap env vars marked deprecated.

### Changed

- **Single binary**: `ferrogw-cli` has been merged into `ferrogw` as Cobra subcommands (`doctor`, `status`, `admin`, `validate`, `plugins`, `version`). Running `ferrogw` with no subcommand still starts the server (backward compatible).
- **`proxyAuth`**: `/v1/*` routes now enforce `AuthMiddleware` by default and are only open when `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_PROXY=true` is set for local development. Operational endpoints such as `/metrics`, `/debug/vars`, and `/debug/pprof/*` continue to require auth.
- **Enhanced startup banner**: Shows top-5 provider status, masked master key, key store / config store backends, and a warning when deprecated bootstrap keys are in use.
- **Bootstrap keys deprecated**: `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` and `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_READ_ONLY_KEY` still work but are superseded by `MASTER_KEY`. They only activate when the key store is empty.

### Removed

- **`cmd/ferrogw-cli/` directory**: Deleted. All CLI commands live in `internal/cli/` and are wired as Cobra subcommands of `ferrogw`.
- **`make build-cli` Makefile target**: Removed. `make build` produces the single `ferrogw` binary.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **`X-Gateway-Overhead-Ms` response header**: Every response now includes gateway processing overhead in milliseconds, letting clients isolate gateway latency from provider latency.
- **Live upstream benchmark in README**: Measured overhead against live OpenAI API — **0.002 ms** bare proxy, **0.025 ms** with plugins enabled.
- **Docker Compose dev/prod split**: New `docker-compose.dev.yml` (build from source, debug logging, Ollama host access) and `docker-compose.prod.yml` (pinned image, restart policy, health check, resource limits, log rotation).

### Changed

- **Config examples**: Added all 29 providers as targets, conditional routing examples, retry/circuit-breaker config, and previously undocumented plugin fields (`max_input_length`, `burst`, `max_keys`).
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Refactored to shared base config with commented env var stubs for all 29 providers.
- **AGENTS.md / CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated "Adding a New Provider" checklist with config example and docker-compose steps; removed duplicate sections.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-27

### Security

- **SQL injection (gosec G701)**: Replaced ad-hoc `db.Exec(query, ...)` calls with pre-compiled prepared statements (`*sql.Stmt`) in `SQLStore`. All six write operations (`Revoke`, `Update`, `SetExpiration`, `Delete`, `ValidateKey`, `RotateKey`) and both SELECT queries (`Get`, `ValidateKey`) now use `stmt.Exec` / `stmt.QueryRow`, eliminating any query-string taint path.
- **SSRF (gosec G704)**: Added `url.Parse` + scheme/host validation in the `New()` constructor of every provider that accepts a configurable base URL (Anthropic, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenAI, Together AI). The catalog remote-fetch helper (`models/catalog.go`) validates the URL before making the HTTP request.

### Changed

- **`SQLStore.scanOne`**: Signature changed from `scanOne(query string, arg interface{})` to `scanOne(stmt *sql.Stmt, arg any)` — callers pass a prepared statement instead of a raw query string.
- **`SQLStore.Close`**: Now closes all prepared statements before closing the database connection.

### Quality

- **staticcheck QF1012**: Replaced `WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...))` with `fmt.Fprintf` in `internal/admin/sql_store.go`, `internal/requestlog/store.go`, and `providers/bedrock/bedrock.go`.
- **revive unused-parameter**: Renamed unused `cmd` parameter to `_` in `internal/cli/doctor.go`.

### Improved

- **CLI overhaul**:
  - **New banner**: Replaced the block-art ASCII logo with a Figlet "doom" font rendering of `FERRO LABS` — orange bold + dim white side-by-side with proper column alignment.
  - **`version` command**: Expanded output to include `commit`, `built`, `go` runtime version, and `os/arch` alongside the version string. JSON/YAML output formats include all fields.
  - **Custom help template**: Grouped help output into `Commands` and `Admin API` sections for a cleaner overview.
  - **`--no-color` flag**: New persistent flag on the root command; also respects the `NO_COLOR` environment variable (https://no-color.org/).
  - **ANSI colour system**: Centralised `clr(code, s string)` helper in `output.go` with `colorOrange`, `colorBold`, `colorDim`, `colorGreen`, `colorRed`, and `colorYellow` constants. `printSuccess` now renders with a green `✓` prefix.
  - **`status` and `doctor` commands**: Registered in the command tree.

### Developer Experience

- **Git hooks (`.husky/`)**: Added `pre-commit` (runs `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`) and `pre-push` (runs `go test`) hooks. Scripts use direct `go` commands — no `make` dependency, works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (Git Bash).
- **`make vet`**: New Makefile target for `go vet ./...`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-24

The first stable release of Ferro Labs AI Gateway — a production-grade, OpenAI-compatible AI gateway written in Go.

### What's in v1.0.0

- **29 built-in providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Bedrock, Vertex AI, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Cloudflare, Azure OpenAI, Azure Foundry, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Cohere, Together AI, Fireworks, Replicate, Ollama, Databricks, DeepInfra, Moonshot, Novita, NVIDIA NIM, Cerebras, Perplexity, Qwen, SambaNova, and AI21.
- **8 routing strategies** — single, fallback, load balance, least latency, cost-optimized, content-based, A/B test, and conditional.
- **6 built-in OSS plugins** — word-filter, max-token, response-cache, request-logger, rate-limit, and budget.
- **MCP tool server integration** — agentic tool-call loops with Streamable HTTP transport, tool filtering, and bounded call depth.
- **Admin API and dashboard** — API key management, usage stats, request logs, config history with rollback, and a built-in dashboard UI.
- **Persistence backends** — memory, SQLite, and PostgreSQL for runtime config, API keys, and request logs.
- **Performance** — 13,925 RPS at 1,000 concurrent users, 32 MB base memory, per-provider HTTP connection pools, sync.Pool for request structs and JSON buffers, zero-allocation stream detection.

### Upgrading from rc.3

No breaking changes from `1.0.0-rc.3`. Updated README and CONTRIBUTING docs for stable release.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>1.0.0-rc.3</strong> — 2026-03-23</summary>

### Highlights

- Gateway hot path overhead reduced from 1,269µs to ~200µs (6.3x faster).
- Throughput at c=50 improved from 2,444 to 25,846 RPS (10.6x faster).
- New `internal/transport` package with per-provider isolated HTTP pools.
- Fixed response-cache bug that collapsed message ordering (#44).

### Bug Fixes

- **response-cache: preserve message order in cache key** (#44): The
  `cacheKey` function sorted messages before hashing, causing two requests
  with identical messages in different order to produce the same cache key.
  Removed `sort.Strings` — cache keys now preserve conversation order using
  incremental `sha256.New()` writes. ([2cd281a])

### Performance

- **`internal/transport/` package**: Per-provider isolated HTTP client pools
  with production-tuned settings. Separate streaming transport with no
  `ResponseHeaderTimeout` for SSE. Known provider presets for OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Vertex AI, Groq, Ollama, and Azure OpenAI.
  Prometheus metrics for connection pool observability.
- **Per-provider HTTP clients**: All 28 providers now use
  `httpclient.ForProvider(Name)` for isolated connection pools instead of a
  single shared client. Legacy completions handler switched from
  `http.DefaultClient`.
- **sync.Pool for request structs**: `routeChatCompletionRequest` (19-field
  reset) and `plugin.Context` (metadata map capacity preserved) are now
  pooled. All fields explicitly reset before pool return for multi-tenant
  safety.
- **Pooled JSON marshaling buffers**: Added `core.MarshalJSON` and
  `core.JSONBodyReader` backed by `sync.Pool`. All 28 provider subpackages
  updated to use pooled buffers for request body serialization.
- **getStrategy() lock contention fix**: Changed from exclusive `Mutex.Lock`
  to double-checked locking with `RLock` fast path. Eliminates write-lock
  serialization on every request under concurrent load.
- **Cached target key slices**: Pre-computed target key ordering for
  single/fallback strategy modes avoids `[]string` allocation on every
  streaming request.
- **Batched RLock in RouteStream**: Merged two separate `g.mu.RLock()`
  acquisitions (provider resolution + catalog snapshot) into one.
- **SSE-optimized buffer pools**: Pooled `bufio.Reader` (64KB) and
  `bufio.Writer` (4KB) for streaming request/response handling.
- **Zero-alloc `IsStreamingRequest`**: Byte-scanning `"stream":true`
  detection with no JSON parsing and 0 allocations.
